# 🎨 My New Portfolio

This is my new portfolio site — built using **Three.js**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **GSAP**.  
It’s a mix of 3D visuals, smooth animations, and modern web tech. Still evolving, but already proud of how it looks and feels.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/):** 3D rendering and interactive visuals
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** UI components and structure
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** Framework for SSR, routing, and optimization
- **[GSAP](https://gsap.com/):** Animation powerhouse

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```
